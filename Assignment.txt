Assignment 3
Create 3 classes: Circle, Square and Triangle
Create a base Thing class to handle the shared logic between these classes
Make the shapes each move in a unique way.
Circles can only move up and down randomly.
Squares can only move left and right randomly.
Triangles can only move on the diagonals.
Make sure you handle collisions properly with the edges. I noticed that you didnt handle the case of when the circle hits the edge properly and part of the circle is exiting the canvas.
